I am particularly interested in:\n\n1700-1917 processes of urbanization, colonization and subsequent industrialization attempts\npost-WWII Soviet Union industrial economic geography\npost-WWII Soviet political economy, especially concerning the military-industrial complex, natural resources and rent-seeking\nnationalism in Soviet Union regions (both USSR republics and RSFSR ethnic regions) and its effects during the breakup of the Soviet Union and 1990s as a whole\nafrican economic history, especially with regards to the effects of decolonization processes and Cold War era aid/military/political support on modern economic development outcomes.\n\nApart from economic history, I am also interested in data science, geospatial analytics and computational social sciences. Moreover, I hope to keep an open mind to any topic and firmly believe that collaboration dynamics, quality of work and real-world significance dictate interest in a project more than the particularities of the subject matter.\nI do not use ChatGPT or any other AI models to generate any text on this website or in my projects. I do (currently) use GitHub Co-Pilot as it is sometimes helpful with repetitive code exercises.\nSome of my data analyses and academic works are available on my GitHub page as a portfolio. I am also on Twitter and LinkedIn in professional capacity."
